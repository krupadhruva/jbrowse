# Basic instructions

* Requires Orbstack (or Docker) to run jbrowse2
* Type `make run`  and follow instructions

### Installation

#### Orbstack for running and managing Linux containers on your computer

* Go to https://orbstack.dev/ and follow instructions to download and install on your computer (desktop/laptop)
* Open your system terminal (command shell) and type `docker --version`. If you do not see any errors, you are ready to run `jbrowse2` bundled in a container

## TODO

* Download and bundle custom data before starting jbrowse2 container
* Hot loading of data from host machine without having to restart container
* Nice CLI to run above commands using Python `argparse` package
